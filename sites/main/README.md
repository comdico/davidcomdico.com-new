# davidcomdico.com-old

Static site converted to a Vite-based project while preserving the original HTML/CSS/JS.

## Commands

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Start the dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This runs the Vite dev server and watches `public/css`, syncing changes into `dist/css` so the output stays in step during development.

Build for production (outputs to `dist/`):

```sh
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```sh
npm run preview
```
