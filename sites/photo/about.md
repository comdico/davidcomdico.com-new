  <p>David Comdico is a photographer whose work explores the subtle tension between the everyday and the extraordinary.
  With an eye for moments that might otherwise slip by unnoticed, David’s images often linger on the edges of urban life,
  street scenes, and fleeting human gestures.</p>
  <p>Influenced by documentary traditions and contemporary visual culture, his photographs have been featured in zines,
  online publications, and group exhibitions.</p>
  <p>When he’s not photographing, David writes about the intersections of photography, memory, and modern perception.</p>
